# Exercise-04c-Enemies

## Implementation
For this exercise, I implemented the following additional features into the game:
A scoring systems where enemies and collectibles give the player points
4 levels, each of which is long, implements new mechanics, such as wall jumping, spikes, and new enemies, and increase in difficulty as they progress.
4 different types of enemies: chargers, chasers, jumpers, and droppers
Spikes that kill the player
Main and end menu
A diamond hidden in each level that rewards the player for exploration
Sound effects and music
